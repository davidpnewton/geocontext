## List of "interesting" per country/territory properties

The territory names are hierarchical as in __country__ or __country__-__territory__ to allow overriding higher level values (for example in the US Virgin Islands there is left hand traffic, so that requires an entry for us-vi). Note the lower level entries do not inherit properties from higher level ones.
